Mostly isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki quickly created new ways to kill each other. This penchant for violence has made the species infamous for seeking out any reason to fight. Despite their own oppression and struggles, most Rattataki feel superior to and look down on other enslaved species. The pale-skinned Rattataki are made for battle. Centuries of constant warfare have weeded out the weak, shaping the remainder into proud, passionate, and deadly combatants. Even entertainment for this violent species is combat; the gladiator pits of their home planet, Rattatak, are the planet&#39;s most popular amusement, well-known for being the most brutal in the galaxy. Exposed to their species&#39; competitive culture from birth, Rattataki develop into fearsome warriors. Deep in the Outer Rim, the Rattataki species evolved in bleak isolation for thousands of years, clinging to existence in sprawling caverns beneath the planet&#39;s surface. They were driven underground by monstrous beasts they believed were gods and savage storms that made the land nearly uninhabitable. In their subterranean exile, the Rattataki tribes fought amongst themselves incessantly over scarce resources, and many tribes even resorted to cannibalism. The weak and the sick were sacrificed so that the strong might survive and one day claim the surface world. Eventually, the mighty warlord Rattatak managed to unite his people long enough to drive back the horrible beasts on the planet&#39;s surface and establish mighty fortresses amidst the mountainous terrain.<br>Though his life was lost in the struggle on the surface, Rattatak&#39;s name lived on. The unification of the Rattataki was brief, and tribes settled back into their constant infighting, but at long last they had emerged from their dark exile and contact was made with the greater galaxy. This led many Rattataki to settle on other worlds, becoming sought after mercenaries, bodyguards and bounty hunters. Shortly after the Empire returned to Republic space, the young Sith Lord Darth Vich took notice of Rattatak and its people. Eager to make a name for himself, he journeyed to the planet and, casting aside 1000 years of anti-alien tradition, recruited a hundred tribes of Rattataki to populate his own personal army. Their prowess in battle made them a dangerous force, and the dozens of Force Sensitive among them became his personal acolytes. With the Rattataki at his command, Darth Vich made a play for power in the Sith Empire that ultimately failed. In the wake of this failure, the Dark Council enslaved or killed all of the Rattataki who followed Vich.

However, while the Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS) keeps detailed records of starship transponder codes, it only releases these records to the proper authorities  local planetary defense forces, starport authorities and, of course, the Imperial Navy and Imperial Customs. Should characters somehow get BoSS records and download them into their ship&#39;s sensors computer, they might be able to identify other vessels by their transponder codes. Of course, if the ship has a false transponder code, this information can be worthless anyway.Scanning Planets: Scanning for specific objects on a planet&#39;s surface can be fairly difficult. While it&#39;s easy to find major landmarks  continents, mountain chains, inland seas and so forth  a planet&#39;s geothermal functions, the energy generated by large settlements, large concentrations of metal, and other energy sources can distort sensor readings, especially if the sensor is looking for a small facility but scanning a large area. Often, sensor operators must greatly limit their scanning area  covering perhaps a few square kilometers at a time  to find military bases, small cities and other &#34;minor&#34; landmarks.The basic sensors difficulty depends upon how much of the planet is being scanned. No more than half a planet may be scanned because only one hemisphere is visible at any given time.Characters normally make a general scan of the planet to determine basic characteristics  atmosphere type, presence of major geographic features, scans for energy readings typical of very large cities  and then conduct increasingly detailed scans on smaller and smaller areas to determine information about interesting landmarks.These sample difficulties are for scanning from orbit and finding a specific item  such as a starport, small town, factory complex, scout base, Imperial garrison or industrial compound  when scanning an area of a certain size.<table><tr><td>Difficulty</td><td>Area being searched</td></tr><tr><td>Very Easy (5)</td><td>One square kilometer or less</td></tr><tr><td>Easy (10)</td><td>One hundred square kilometers or less</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate (15)</td><td>One thousand square kilometers or less</td></tr><tr><td>Difficult (20)</td><td>One million square kilometers or less</td></tr><tr><td>Very Difficult (25)</td><td>One hundred million square kilometers or less</td></tr><tr><td>Heroic (30)</td><td>One planetary hemisphere</td></tr><tr><td>Are you  kidding me?

The GM decides the distance is about 50 meters, and sets the target as Difficult (20). Jedley has a Force Leap score of 6. He rolls a 14. Since (14 + 6) = 20, he squeaks by with the barest minimum of successes. His Dodge Skill Level is a modest 3. Jedley makes his Dodge Skill Check. He rolls a 12.
